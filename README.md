# Joshua Holland

Principal Systems & Security Engineer  
Architecting, operating, and securing production systems end-to-end.

## What I do

I design and run real production platforms.

That means owning:
- System architecture
- Cloud infrastructure
- Security & DevSecOps
- CI/CD and automation
- Observability and incident response
- Cost and operational trade-offs

Most of my work powers revenue-generating SaaS products and lives in private repositories.

## What this GitHub represents

This profile contains **selected public reference implementations** extracted from production systems, including:

- Multi-tenant architecture patterns (Postgres RLS, isolation boundaries)
- AI-orchestrated engineering workflows (human-in-the-loop)
- Observability, incident response, and operational tooling
- Infrastructure and cost-control primitives

Everything here reflects **production constraints**, not demos or toy projects.

---

## What you won’t find here

- Tutorial repos
- Framework experiments
- Half-finished side projects

If it’s public, it exists to demonstrate **engineering judgment**, not syntax.

---

## How I work

I operate as the system architect and technical owner, increasingly using AI agents as force multipliers.

I define constraints, policies, and success criteria; machines execute; humans review.

This approach has replaced entire engineering teams while improving speed, quality, and reliability.
