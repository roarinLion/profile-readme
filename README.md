## What I do

I design and operate production systems end-to-end.
That includes architecture, security, CI/CD, observability, and cost control.

Most of my work lives in private repositories because it powers real businesses.

## What you’ll find here

This GitHub contains selected public reference implementations extracted from production systems:
- Multi-tenant security patterns
- AI orchestration pipelines
- Observability and incident response tooling
- Infrastructure and cost controls

## What you won’t find here

Toy projects, demos, or unfinished experiments.
Everything here reflects production constraints and real trade-offs.
